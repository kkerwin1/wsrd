# Introduction

The WSRD, or WoW Standard Reference Document, is a document inspired by Dungeon and Dragons Fifth Edition. The goal is to produce a tabletop-style roleplaying game in the vein of D&D, but with original mechanics that do not infringe upon the D&D intellectual property. Inspiration informing scale and scope comes from the D&D SRD, while the inspiration for flavor and mechanics comes from WoW.
