# How to read this book

This book is designed to be read like a cookbook, rather than a novel: a little here, and a little there, and certainly not from cover-to-cover. 

It is hoped that the book will be well-organized and easily citable. Indeed, the author regularly uses the Program Operations Manual System \(POMS\), essentially the manual comprising the standard operating procedures of the Social Security Administration in the United States. This book uses a citation system similar to that used by the POMS to facilitate the organization of the book as well as citation to assist with communicating which rule is being referred to between players and GMs during discussion.
