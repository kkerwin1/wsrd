# How to read this book

A. The Basics

This book is designed to be read like a cookbook, rather than a novel: a little here, and a little there, and certainly not from cover-to-cover. 

B. Citation

It is hoped that the book will be well-organized and easily citable. Indeed, the author regularly uses the Program Operations Manual System \(POMS\), essentially the manual comprising the standard operating procedures of the Social Security Administration in the United States. This book uses a citation system similar to that used by the POMS to facilitate the organization of the book as well as citation to assist with communicating which rule is being referred to between players and GMs during discussion. To illustrate, the citation of this entry, FM 10101.003B, is used:

| FM | 1 | 01 | 01 | .003 | B |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Manual | Unit | Chapter | Section | Page | Intrapage Citation |

B1. Manuals

The FM is an abbreviation for this manual, the "Front Matter". There are five manuals in this book:

| Manual Name | Manual Abbreviation | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Front Matter | FM | Administrivia |
| Player Manual | PM | Information for Players |
| GM Manual | GM | Information for GMs |
| NPC Manual | NM | Stat blocks representing NPCs |
| Legends Manual | LM | Information regarding Legends, the associated addon |

B2. Units

Units are the largest component of an individual manual. For example, the Player Manual is divided into broad headings like "Basic Rules", "Character Customization", "Items", "Spells", etc. Yet under the "Character Customization", there are several smaller headings, such as classes, backgrounds, races, etc.

B3. Chapters

Chapters are the next-smallest heading. For example, under "Character Customization", we would find Chapters such as "Classes", "Backgrounds", "Races", "Crafting", etc.

B4. Sections

A section is the next-smallest heading. For example, under the "Classes" chapter, we would find a section for each individual class, such as Shaman, or Priest.

B5. Pages

A page is the smallest discrete heading in this book. For example, under the Shaman section, there might be a page for each subclass: Elemental, Enhancement, or Restoration. Pages ending in ".000" are tables of contents for their respective unit/chapter/section/etc.

B6. Intrapage citation

These letters and numbers assist with locating specific pieces of evidence within a page. Intrapage citations work like an outline: capital letter &gt; Arabic numeral &gt; lower-case letter &gt; Roman numeral. As you may have gathered, the full citation for this paragraph is "FM 10101.003B6".
